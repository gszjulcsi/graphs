Graph Algorithms in Go
======================

This repository contains implementations of various graph algorithms written
in Go. I’ve written them to learn about these algorithms.

Implemented
-----------

* Graph data structure
* Set data structure
* [Kruskal’s algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm)

Todo
----

* [Breadth-first search](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)
* [Depth-first search](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
* [Dijkstra's algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djikstra%27s_Algorithm)
